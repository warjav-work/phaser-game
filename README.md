## Phaser 3 Open-wc Starter App

A Phaser 3 project template.

This has been updated for Phaser 3.55.2 version and above.

Loading images via JavaScript module `import` is also supported, although not recommended.

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Quickstart

To get started:

```bash
npm init @open-wc
# requires node 10 & npm 6 or higher
```

## Scripts

- `start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `test` runs your test suite with Web Test Runner
- `lint` runs the linter for your project
- `format` fixes linting and formatting errors

## Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.
